<h1> Advent of Code 2023 </h1>

The participation in Advent of Code in 2023 was exceptional for me. I decided to start solving all questions once they were published, and as a result, I changed my habits to get up earlier. That's why, every day between the 1st and 25th of December, I woke up at 6 AM to solve a daily Advent of Code question. I had a lot of trouble trying to solve these questions, especially since most of the time I felt sleepy, but once I got an idea of how to solve them, the excitement was great. Starting to solve daily tasks at 6 AM let me use the time to submit an answer as a good measure of how fast I solved a single question. Key takeaways from this time: 
* math knowledge was super helpful this year (e.g., Day 8, Day 18, Day 24),
* the toughest day was the 21st; I managed to solve this with a few tips (more than 6 hours of working),
* the fastest day when I submitted both parts was Day 6,
* achieved a global rank < 1000 only once for the second part (Day 24).

Below you can find the graph with personal times and a little animation I did for Day 23.
