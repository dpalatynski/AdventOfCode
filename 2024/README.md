<h1> Advent of Code 2024 </h1>

This year I was able to participate only in a part of the Advent of Code 2024 event due to the beginning of my holidays in the middle of December. Similar to last year, I woke up every day before 6AM and solved AoC questions. I was able to reach top 400 in Day 3 and got a better time of solving the first 15 days than the year before (only 3 out of 15 days took me more than 1 hour). I will catch up with the remaining days hopefully in the first quarter of 2025 and I will update this description.
