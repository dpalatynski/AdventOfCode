<h1> Advent of Code </h1>
Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions and other files with code, animations, and images which I created for the Advent of Code programming challenges. Each year is organized into its dedicated directory, and for each task, the corresponding input is also provided and uploaded.

<h2> About Advent of Code </h2>

<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is an annual programming event conceived by <a target="_new" href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. This engaging initiative takes the form of an Advent calendar, featuring small programming puzzles that cater to a diverse range of skill sets and experience levels. These challenges can be tackled using the programming language of your choice. Participants leverage Advent of Code for various purposes, such as interview preparation, company training, university coursework, practice problems, speed contests, or friendly challenges.

You don't need a computer science background to participate; a modest understanding of programming and some problem-solving skills will take you a long way. Additionally, it's worth noting that you don't require high-end hardware, as every problem is designed to have a solution that can be executed in at most 15 seconds, even on a ten-year-old computer. This inclusive and accessible approach makes Advent of Code an exciting and rewarding experience for a wide range of enthusiasts.

In 2023, I enthusiastically participated in Advent of Code, waking up each day to tackle the daily programming puzzles as soon as they were released. The experience was both challenging and rewarding.

Advent of Code 2022 was the first encounter with this programming challenge. During this first year, I engaged with the puzzles occasionally.

<h2> Previous years </h2>
Hopefully, I will be catching up with previous editions, only to develop my skills and have a lot of enjoyment!
